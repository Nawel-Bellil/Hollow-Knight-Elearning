     Why Use GraphQL After Defining REST APIs?

-1- Efficient Data Fetching: Clients can request exactly the data they 
need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.
-2- Unified API: Consolidate multiple REST endpoints into a single GraphQL
 endpoint, simplifying client interactions.
-3- Improved Performance: Minimize the number of requests needed to fetch
 related data.
-4- Better Tooling: Use GraphQL's introspection to automatically generate
 documentation and enhance development tools.
-5- Easier Evolution: Add new fields and types without affecting existing
 queries, reducing the need for versioning.
